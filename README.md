## Introduction

DevOps is a set of practices that emphasizes collaboration between software development and IT operations teams. DevSecOps extends these practices to integrate security throughout the software development lifecycle, while SRE focuses on achieving high reliability and availability. This roadmap is tailored to individuals pursuing proficiency in DevOps, DevSecOps, and SRE.
