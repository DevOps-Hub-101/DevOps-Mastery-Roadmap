## Introduction

DevOps is a set of practices that emphasizes collaboration between software development and IT operations teams. This roadmap is tailored to DevOps Engineers and Azure Administrators who aim to optimize software development workflows, enhance system resilience, and implement robust security measures.

## Roadmap Stages

The roadmap consists of four stages, each building upon the previous one:

1. **Getting Started:** Lay the foundation with basic DevOps concepts, version control, and continuous integration.

2. **Intermediate Stage:** Dive deeper into infrastructure as code, continuous deployment, and containerization.

3. **Advanced Stage:** Explore cloud platforms, advanced CI/CD strategies, and security in DevOps.

4. **Expert Stage:** Master DevOps culture, advanced cloud architectures, and advanced monitoring techniques.
